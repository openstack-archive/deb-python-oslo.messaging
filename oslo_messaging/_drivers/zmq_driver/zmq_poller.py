    """Base poller interface

    Needed to poll on zmq sockets in green and native async manner.
    Native poller implementation wraps zmq.Poller helper class.
    Wrapping is needed to provide unified poller interface
    in zmq-driver (for both native and zmq pollers). It makes some
    difference with poller-helper from zmq library which doesn't actually
    receive message.

    The poller object should be obtained over:

        poller = zmq_async.get_poller()

    Then we have to register sockets for polling. We are able
    to provide specific receiving method. By default poller calls
    socket.recv_multipart.

        def receive_message(socket):
            id = socket.recv_string()
            ctxt = socket.recv_json()
            msg = socket.recv_json()
            return (id, ctxt, msg)

        poller.register(socket, recv_method=receive_message)

    Further to receive a message we should call:

        message, socket = poller.poll()

    The 'message' here contains (id, ctxt, msg) tuple.
